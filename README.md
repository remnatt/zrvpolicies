> **85+ Members**
> **Must not slander or talk bad about DBLPS**

# 004 - Staff abusing a member

> If a member says you are abusing but they broke a rule you must send proof of them breaking that rule.

# 005 - Server arguements
> Any beef/fighting will result in a ban. Unless you are me, cause how else will yall get the ps 🤷‍♂️

# 006 - Harsh punishment
> If you are a staff please remember to not be too harsh with punishing a member. If you think its needed because they don't listen then confront a higher up before doing it.
